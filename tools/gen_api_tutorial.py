r"""Generate an mdBook API-reference tutorial from this package's own
source, in the tutorials/ directory (same mdBook layout vani-compiler's
own tutorials/ uses, so `mdbook build tutorials/` + GitHub Pages just
works with no per-repo tooling changes).

Ecosystem-wide "publish a tutorial explaining every function, with a
real example" CI idea, rolled out to every vani-* package. Mostly
mechanical, not hand-authored prose: vāṇी has no formal doc-comment
syntax and no `vanic doc` extractor as of this writing, so per-function
text is EXTRACTED from the source, verbatim, not invented:

  1. The plain `//` comment block immediately preceding each `fn`
     (this package's own existing informal doc-comment convention --
     confirmed present above nearly every function in src/lib.vani).
     Skips over `#[attribute]` lines between the comment and the `fn`.
  2. The first real call site for that function name found in tests/
     or examples/ (tests searched first, since they're closer to
     "ground truth" usage) -- a single source line, not synthesized.

A function with neither is rendered honestly as a gap ("no comment
above this function" / "no usage example found"), not papered over --
the point is to surface real documentation debt, not manufacture the
appearance of completeness.

The one deliberate exception to "extract, don't invent": an optional
tools/tutorial_extras.json sidecar, hand-authored ONCE per package
(like book.toml -- scaffolded, not regenerated), supplying:

  - "why_use_this": a short paragraph explaining what real problem the
    package solves and when to reach for it -- the one thing a bare
    signature+example reference genuinely can't answer on its own.
    Rendered on the index page.
  - "math_notes": a {function_name: value} map for the functions
    whose behavior is naturally a formula (e.g. a sparse matrix-
    vector product, a numerical-integration rule). Each value is
    EITHER a plain string (legacy, rendered as one "**Math**" block)
    OR a dict with up to four textbook-style sections, rendered as
    labeled subsections in this order:
      - "intuition": a plain-language analogy or motivating question
        -- why does this operation exist, what problem does it solve,
        BEFORE any notation appears. Written for a reader seeing the
        concept for the first time, not someone who already knows it.
      - "formula": the actual LaTeX statement of the operation.
      - "example": a SMALL, fully worked, hand-verifiable numeric
        example -- real numbers, every intermediate step shown, a
        final answer a reader could check by hand. Not a code
        snippet (that's the separate, auto-extracted "Example"
        section below it) -- a textbook-style worked calculation.
      - "why": why this specific function/approach matters in
        practice, or what it costs/saves compared to the naive
        alternative.
    Every section uses MathJax's \( \) / \[ \] delimiters where
    needed (book.toml enables mathjax-support). Functions without an
    entry get no Math section at all -- most functions (constructors,
    accessors, plumbing) don't need one; reserve this for the
    functions where seeing the concept worked out actually helps.

    Author math_notes entries with NORMAL, single-backslash LaTeX
    (`\( y = Ax \)`, `\sum_{j}`, `\text{rows}`, `\,`, etc.) -- do NOT
    hand-double the backslashes. `escape_latex_for_markdown()` below
    does that mechanically at render time, because mdBook's CommonMark
    renderer otherwise silently strips a single backslash before any
    ASCII punctuation character (confirmed against a real build: `\(`
    in the source becomes bare `(` in the output, breaking MathJax,
    unless the generator doubles it first). Backslash-before-LETTER
    (`\sum`, `\text`, ...) is untouched by CommonMark either way.

Regenerate with:
    python3 tools/gen_api_tutorial.py

Usage: run from the package root (reads vani.toml's [package].entry).
Writes tutorials/src/api_reference.md, tutorials/src/index.md,
tutorials/src/SUMMARY.md, and tutorials/book.toml. Safe to re-run --
fully regenerates the three src/*.md files from current source state
each time (book.toml and tutorial_extras.json are scaffolded once and
left alone). Do not hand-edit the generated src/*.md files; edit the
// comments in src/lib.vani (or tutorial_extras.json for the two
hand-authored fields) and re-run.
